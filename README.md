# covid_19

A basic app to track COVID-19 patients in India.

Yes, the app isn't responsive, but I will plan on adding these features later.

How to build the app: Please refer APACHE Cordova's Documentation - it will help you, starting from how to set up, onto how you can build this for Android or iOS
